# Thursdays at Ada Norms

* **Attendance at Thursdays at Ada is required for graduation** from the program. 
  * We understand that sometimes things come up and external circumstances may cause you to miss a session. If you need to miss a CS Fundamentals or Career Services lesson, please send an email to [absent_internship@adadevelopersacademy.org
  ](mailto:absent_internship@adadevelopersacademy.org
  ) in advance when possible.
* CS Fundamentals assignments are a required part of your continuing education and graduation requirements. 
  * **You need to complete 7 of the 8 exercises for CS Fundamentals**. 
  * Please contact your instructors and make use of the TAs for support. 
* There will be some required submissions for the Career Services lessons.
* Career Development facilitators and speakers are volunteers who are excited to share their expertise with you. 
  * Please keep your video on during Thursdays at Ada sessions, with the understanding that sometimes video on will not feel comfortable, and that is okay.
  * Please try to stay as engaged as possible (answering questions, responding in the chat, participating in interactive breakout sessions or sharing out your thoughts if you are comfortable).
