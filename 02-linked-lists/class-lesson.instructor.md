# Instructor Notes

Linked Lists are a core learning concept in computer science and a common interview question. 

## Lesson Goals

We want students to:

- Get comfortable using ListNodes
  - Using them to traverse a list
  - Manipulating them to add and remove nodes
  - Identify the time complexity of methods involving linked lists

## Lesson Introduction - 30 minutes

Start off the lesson by welcoming students to the class and note attendance. You can use the Google Form  The [C17 Attendance Tracking](https://forms.gle/UcN9UnhMjeKve6SB6) is linked.

Given that this is the first CS Fundamentals session, spend some time motivating CS Fundamentals content (how does it assist their job search and complement internship learning?) and going over logistics - attendance, feedback, learning plans, etc.

## Problem Set Review - 45 mintues


Conduct a problem set review. Students can ask general questions about lesson content as well as request review of specific problems in the problem set. 

Then follow the 1st part of the [activity](./06-linked-list-activity.md) reviewing where linked lists are useful (when you need to add/remove to the front/rear of a list).  

## Livecode - 20 minutes

In the livecode walk through:

1.  Merge Sorted Lists from the text lesson
1.  Setup the project and write 2 methods

Remember to:

- Try to get students to navigate as you type.  
- Cause a bug, and try to promote student ideas to fix it.  
- Model how to use the tests and print statements.

## Coding Activity - 40 minutes

Break students into breakout rooms to practice the replit. Optionally you can complete one exercise as a class before breaking the remainder into groups.

Iterate through the breakout rooms answering questions as you go.

## Solution Examples

You can find a solution in [Chris' Replit](https://replit.com/@ChrisMcAnally/List-Practice-Solution#).

*Code Snippet: is_palindrome*
```py
from typing import Optional

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value, next = None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"ListNode({self.value})"

def transform_to_doubly_linked_list(head: ListNode):
    previous = None
    current = head
    while current is not None:
        current.previous = previous
        previous = current
        current = current.next

    return previous

def is_palindrome(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    if head is None:
        return True

    tail = transform_to_doubly_linked_list(head)

    while (head != tail):
        if head.value != tail.value:
            return False
        head = head.next
        tail = tail.previous
    
    return True
```

*Code Snippet: Rotate Linked List*

```py

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, value, next = None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def add_first(head: ListNode, node: ListNode):
    node.next = head
    return node

def find_last_and_second_to_last(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    previous = None
    current = head

    while current.next is not None:
        previous = current
        current = current.next
    
    return (previous, current)

def rotate_list(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    
    if head is None:
        return None
    if k < 0:
        raise ValueError("k must be positive")
    elif k == 0 or head.next is None:
        return head
    
    for i in range(k):
        (new_tail, tail) = find_last_and_second_to_last(head)

        new_tail.next = None
        head = add_first(head, tail)

    return head
```
### !callout-secondary

## This isn't efficient

This is **not** an efficient solution.  To do this more efficiently (not O(nk) time), we would potentially need to transform this into a doubly linked list or copy it into an array, or calculate the length of the list and a way to rotate in reverse to get a similar outcome.

### !end-callout


*Code Snippet: Has Cycle*
```py
def has_cycle(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
    if not head:
        return False

    current = head
    trailing = head

    while current:
        current = current.next
        if current:
            current = current.next
        trailing = trailing.next

        if current and current == trailing:
            return True
    return False

```
