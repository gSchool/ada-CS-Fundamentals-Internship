## Terms & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|--- |--- |
| **Bucket** | An space in the internal array used by a hash table. |
| **Clustering** | When multiple elements are mapped to the same bucket in a hash table. |
| **Collision** | When two keys are mapped to the same bucket in a hash table. |
| **Double Hashing** | A strategy to handle collisions in a hash table where a secondary hash function is used when a collision occurs. |
| **Hash Function** | A function used in a hash table to determine where to place an item into the internal array |
| **Heuristic** | Any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method, not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but works well in practice. |
| **Chaining** | A strategy to handle collisions where each element of a hash table's internal array serves as the head of a linked list.  This allows the same bucket to store multiple items.
| **Linear Probing** | A strategy to handle collisions where if a collision occurs for the hash table to progress iteratively through the array until an empty element is encountered. |
| **Quadratic Probing** | A strategy to handle collisions where if a collision occurs, a function is applied to determine the next index to attempt to place the item.  |
| **Load Factor** | The number of elements in a hash divided by the number of buckets.  A lower load factor generally leads to better time efficiency at the expense of memory usage. |


## Introduction

In practical programming we often spend much more time looking data up in a data structure as opposed to inserting or removing data.  A typical example is a grocery store.  At the checkout point we need to quickly recognize items and look up their prices in order to ring up a bill.  In ye olde days employees often had to memorize the prices of each item.  This worked in small shops, and was supplemented by price tags.  However stores have grown and price tags can fall off or prices change after an item is tagged.  Today most items have been given a unique key called a [Universal Product Code (UPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code).  The software at the point of sale regularly need to look up items from their UPC codes and retrieve the current price.  

![cash register](images/cash-register.jpg)

The systems could use an array to store the data with log<sub>2</sub>(n) retrieval times, or a binary search tree of the data, but in that case for `m` lookups and a universe of `n` products it would take O(mlog<sub>2</sub>n) to complete a transaction.  It would be better to reduce the _per product_ lookup time to a constant and the entire transaction to O(m).

This is where hash tables come in.  Hash tables reduce lookup times to O(1) or constant time.  They do this by trading space complexity for time complexity.  This is a light trade-off since the increased space complexity is linear, O(n).

## Hash Table Overview

A hash table is essentially a generalization of an array.  Each element has a _key_ and _value_.  The key is a unique identifier for the element and can be used to quickly retrieve the value from the table.  This is similar to the way an index number can be quickly used to retrieve an element from an array.  Unlike an index number, a key can be any type of value: a string, a number, or any other kind of object.  

![hash table](images/hash-table.png)

A hash table is built on an array.  When given a key value, the hash table applies a function called a _hash function_ to the key, resulting in a number between 0 and the length of the array.  The hash table then uses that number to either look up or place the item into an element of the array known as a _bucket_.  A bucket is the term used for each element of the hash table's internal array used to store data.

In the image above, given a key, a hash function is run resulting in an index number used by the hash table to identify the bucket used to store the information.

Hash tables are also often called:

- _Dictionaries_ because like a dictionary is used to look up a definition from a word, in a hash table a key is used to look up a value.  This is a term used in Python.
- _Hash Map_ because the hash function helps map an item to its location in a table.

Hash tables perform relatively well in terms of Big-O

### !callout-info

## Notice The Linear Worst-Case Time Complexity

This is because a hash table cannot *absolutely guarantee* an O(1) lookup time. However with a good hash function the worst-case runtime becomes extremely rare resulting in a *practical* time complexity of O(1) for lookup operations. We will address this when we discuss the hashing function.

### !end-callout

## Hashing Functions

The key, no pun intended, to a hash table is the hashing function.  The hashing function is used to convert any key to a number.  That number can then be used to find an index in the internal array used by the hash table.

To be useful in a hash table, the function must satisfy a few criteria:

- **The hash function must be consistent.** - If the hash function of key k, `h(k)` results in a number, it should always result in the same number.
- **The hash function should (mostly) map different keys to different values** - We want to avoid situations where two keys map to the same index in the array.
  - This is even better if the hash function distributes elements uniformly across the collection.
- **The hash function should execute in constant time** - The hashing function should scale well and execute relatively quickly.
- **Hashing should appear to be random** - It should be hard to identify the key from the hashed value.  Hash functions used in hash tables can be reversable, while those used in cryptography should be very hard to reverse.

When a hashing function assigns two different keys to the same bucket, this is known as a _collision_.  Hash tables work most efficiently, as we will see, the fewer collisions they have.

Unfortunately there is no universal hashing function which can take any type of key and guarantee that collisions do not occur and in fact there is no guarantee the hashing function will not cause **every** key in a given application to collide.  This is why hashing functions are known as _heuristics_.  Heuristics are algorithms which work practically well, but may have a mathematically possible worst-case which is unattractive.

Below are two example hash functions.

### The Division Method

In the division method, we convert the key to an integer and then take the remainder of the key divided by the length of the internal array (m).

`h(k) = k mod m`

Because we are taking the remainder of the key divided by the length of the array, we are guaranteed a value `0 <= h(k) < m`.  Therefore the resulting index will be valid for the internal array

We normally use a prime number not close to a power of 2 for `m`, the size of the internal array, because this tends to more evenly disperse the resulting indexes.  Notice that this technique does require a method to convert a non-integer key into an integer.

### The Multiplication Method

In the multiplication method, we create an index in the array by:

1. First multiplying the key by a constant `A` which is between 0 and 1, and taking the decimal result.  
1. Then multiply that by the size of the array `m` and rounding down.

`h(k) = floor(m * (k * A mod 1))`

So if:

- `k` = 37
- `A` = 0.31
- `m` = 100

`h(37) = floor(100 * (37 * 0.31 % 1))`

`h(37) = floor(100 * (11.47 % 1))`

`h(37) = floor(100 * (0.47000000000000064))`

`h(37) = floor(47.000000000000064)`


`h(37) = 47`

<!-- ======================= END CHALLENGE ======================= -->

You are **not** expected to memorize these methods, but rather be able to see how they work to identify a bucket to find values in a hash table.

There are **many** different ways to write a hash function.  There is not a mathematically provable perfect solution, in the general case.  Instead developers use statistical analysis with experimental data to judge the performance of a given hashing function.  When evaluating a hashing function developers want a function which is easy to compute, maps any given input to valid buckets, and minimizes collisions.

[Ruby uses the MurmurHash](https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/) hashing function internally.

### !callout-info

## Sidenote: A Hash Function Can Be A Vulnerability

There was a time when Ruby used the **exact** same hash for every instance of running Ruby.  Then someone exploited a series of keys designed to result in a collision with each insertion into a hash.  This was used in a [denial of service](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/12/28/denial-of-service-attack-was-found-for-rubys-hash-algorithm-cve-2011-4815/) attack on Ruby on Rails.  There is another article on [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/12/huge-portions-of-web-vulnerable-to-hashing-denial-of-service-attack/).

### !end-callout

For Python, the hash function used depends on the object being used as a key.  Each class can define it's own `__hash__()` method and the value that it returns for a particular instance is used for the dictionary.  Python further "salts" it's hash values, so they differ from run to run to prevent the same denial of service attack Ruby servers experienced.

### !callout-info

## If You Want To Know More About Python Internals

You can read about how Python Dictionaries work on [this article](http://thepythoncorner.com/dev/hash-tables-understanding-dictionaries/).  Be aware the article has some formatting issues.

### !end-callout

## Collision Handling

All general-purpose hashing functions will encounter collisions.  When two keys are mapped to the same bucket something has to happen to manage it.  We will look at three methods: chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing and rehashing.

### !callout-info

## Python Dictionary Source Code

If you are interested you can review how [dictionaries, including collision resolution are handled in Python](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/dictobject.c).

### !end-callout

### Chaining

The first solution, as we discussed in the classroom portion of Ada, is to make each bucket of the hash table's internal array the head of a linked list.  Linked lists are quick to insert and remove items O(1) and can store an arbitrary number of elements.  Unfortunately if there are a high number of items in the same bucket, finding an element starts to approach O(n).  However if the hashing function does a good job of spreading elements out over different buckets, the linked lists will be small and the time to search for an item in the hash table approaches O(1).  

![Chaining](images/Example-hash.png)

### Linear Probing

Chaining required a secondary data structure in the array.  Linear probling is instead rather simple.  When inserting a new element into the hash table, the hash function will return with an index number.  If the bucket at that index number is occupied (there's a collision), then the hash table checks the next element in the array, and the next and so on until an empty bucket is found.  Incidentally, this is how Python dictionaries handle collisions.

![Linear Probing](images/linear-probing.png)

Similar to chaining, searching for an empty bucket has a worst-case of O(n).  Also, because we are looking only at adjacent elements for empty buckets, this can lead to a problem with _clustering_.  Clustering means that elements are grouping together into one area in the hash table.  

![Clustering](images/linear-probing-clustering2.png)

If there is a lot of clustering, then operations on a hash table using linear probing approach O(n).  To avoid this we need to use a hashing function which spreads the items over the body of the internal array as evenly as possible.  When a hash function does a good job of spreading elements throughout the array, we can say the hash table is _well spaced_. 

### Quadratic Probing

Quadratic probing is very similar to linear probing in that when inserting an element, if the bucket is full, instead of incrementally searching the array for an empty bucket, a formula is applied to search.  There is no set fomula to use in quadratic clustering - that is another heuristic determined by the developer and experimentation.

**Example**

For example, on the `ith` attempt to find an empty bucket, the formula to determine the next index to check could be:

h(k, i) = (h(k) + i + i<sup>2</sup>) mod m

So if h(k) was 37 and m was 100, the 3rd attempt to find an empty bucket would use:  37 + 3 + 3<sup>2</sup> mod 100 = (37 + 3 + 9) mod 100 = 49

Quadratic probing makes clustering less likely, although not impossible and it performs similarly to linear probing.  [Unfortunately quadratic probing performs worse as the number of elements increases compared to the size of the internal array.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_probing#Limitations)  Unless the internal array is sparsely occupied, quadratic probing could struggle to find an empty bucket.  This is an example of trading space efficiency for time efficiency.  By making the array larger, relative to the data, quadratic probing will approach O(1) time efficiency at the cost of more expensive space efficiency.

### Rehashing

A third solution to collision is to simply have a secondary hash function.  If there is a collision, then use the secondary hash function to find another bucket to use.  There will however be occasions where both hash functions produce a collision and then another collision resolution scheme would need to be used, like chaining or linear probing.  If the _load factor_ - the ratio of the number of elements to the number of buckets in the hash table - is low, then this occurs rarely, and the seconary hash function helps avoid clustering.  As a fun side-note, when you chain several hash functions together it's called [Cuckoo Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing)

## Python Dictionaries

Python uses *[open addressing*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21595048/how-python-dict-stores-key-value-when-collision-occurs#:~:text=Python%20dict%20uses%20open%20addressing,1)%20lookup%20by%20index))*, i.e. *linear probing* to handle collisions. When the dictionary's internal array is 2/3 full, it will double the size of the array and rehash all of the elements ensuring that the elements are spread evenly over the new array and making the internal array less densely populated.

By limiting the density of the hash, Python guarantees the O(1) lookup time for adding elements to the hash.

## When To Use Hash Tables

Now that we've had some theory, when would you expect to use a hash table?  In any problem where quick lookup of items is important, a hash table should be considered.  However a hash table depends on **unique keys**.  If a dataset cannot provide unique key values, a hash table may not be the best solution.  Instead a binary search tree or another data structure may be a better selection.

### Sample Problem

Hash tables are a common, practical solution to a variety of programming problems.  Below is a sample interview problem taking from [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

Given a string, return the distinct letters sorted in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

So for example:

  **Input:**  "party hardy"
  **Output:**  "ayrpt hd"

Would a hash table be a good approach here?  Why or why not?

##### !end-question

##### !placeholder

##### !end-placeholder

##### !hint

To solve this problem we need to store each letter and the number of occurences.  How does a hash compare to a linked list or other implementation?

##### !end-hint

##### !explanation

 - To solve this problem we need to store each letter and the number of occurences. <br />
    - There are a few of ways to do this:
      1. We could traverse the list repeatedly counting the occurences of each letter.  This would require nested loops and O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity.
      1. We could also sort the string by letter and use this sorted string to count the occurences of each letter.  Sorting the string would require O(nlogn) time complexity.
      1. Or we could use a hash table with each character as the keys and the number of occurences as the value.  Building this hash would require one traversal of the string or O(n).  
    - Once we have the list of letters and their number of occurences, we can use this to build the output string.

  Because looking up an item in a hash table is so fast, hash tables turn out to be excellent data structures.

**Problem Description**

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"
```

**Explanation:**
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"
```

**Explanation:**

"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

Below would be a valid solution:

```python
def frequency_sort(s):
    letters = list(s)

    # Get a dictionary with keys of
    # each letter and values storing
    # the count of each letter
    letter_counts = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if not letter_counts.get(letter):
            letter_counts[letter] = 1
        else:
            letter_counts[letter] += 1
    
    # Get a dictionary of with the keys being
    # letter counts and the values being strings
    # storing all the letters with that count 
    # that many times
    # Example:  { 3: 'ttteee' } for "etette"
    max_count = 0
    letter_strings = {}
    for letter, count in letter_counts.items():
        if letter_strings.get(count):
            letter_strings[count] += letter * count
        else:
            letter_strings[count] = letter * count
        
        if max_count < count:
            max_count = count
    

    # Combine the letter strings in descending order
    result = ""
    while max_count > 0:
        if letter_strings.get(max_count):
            result += letter_strings[max_count]
        max_count -= 1

    return result
```

## Summary

Hashes are one of the most practically useful data structures you will encounter.  They make a great many problems easier and with lower time complexity.  You will also likely **never** have to create a hash table data structure yourself, but you will need to know their practical applications and be able to discuss how they function.

There are many ways to structure a hash table.  One of the most common is simple chaining with each element of the internal array or _bucket_ referencing the beginning of a linked list.  Alternative solutions include _dynamic arrays_ which use arrays to store the elements in each bucket and open addressing using either _linear probing_, _quadratic probing_ or _double hashing_.  It's also important to recognize that a hash table depends on **unique** keys.  If the keys for items are not unique there is no way to generate a unique hash result.
