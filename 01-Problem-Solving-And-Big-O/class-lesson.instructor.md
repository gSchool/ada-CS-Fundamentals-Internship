# Instructor Notes

The problem solving class lesson has a few objectives, not all related to the curriculum topic.

## Lesson Goals

- Non-CS Fun Goals
  - Establish classroom expectations and norms
  - Students must complete 7 of 8 projects
  - Attendance is required for Thursdays at Ada
  - Let students know about office hours, from instructors and TAs
  - Review the Calendar
- CS Fun Goals Make sure students can:
  - List the steps in Problem Solving
    - Identify Nominal and Edge-cases
    - Explain refactoring
  - Walk through the types of Big O
    - Analyze a code sample and correctly estimate it's time and space complexity.

## Lesson Introduction - 20 minutes

Start the lesson by welcoming students to the class and note attendance (Note for the future, that Zoom can do attendance tracking).  I (Chris) take screenshots of the participants and use that for attendance later.  You can use the Airtable to record attendance The [C16 Airtable](https://airtable.com/appkfPQ769uxQLSei/tbl6oiA8ZG1wKUonM/viwgf4wesbLFMlg1L?blocks=hide) is linked.

### List Classroom Expectations

- Review the [Ada Norms Doc](../00-about-thursdays-at-ada/norms.md).
  - Areas of focus:
    - Calendar
    - Office Hours
    - 7/8 Projects required
    - Report Absences via [absent_internship@adadevelopersacademy.org](mailto:absent_internship@adadevelopersacademy.org)

### Review the Learn Sections

- CS Fundamentals
- Career Development
  - Specify that this is where they can find the Google Docs Career Services will update

## Lesson Start: Review Topics - 30 minutes

In the [problem solving lesson doc](./01-problem-solving.md) review the `minimum_sub_list_length` problem and ask students the steps in the problem solving process.  

- Clarifying Questions
- Example Input and outputs
  - Ask about *Nominal* and *Edge-cases*
- Look at the given solution

Then have students analyze the solution for time/space complexity.

  - Have them spend 5 minutes looking at it, and write down their analysis before hitting submit in chat.
  - Then get one or more students to explain.

Lastly review the refactor and have students write down their analysis of the solution again.  Get students to explain the answer.

- Make sure students can explain the concept of a *sliding window*.

## Exercise - 30 minutes

The problem is taken from [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/). 

As a class have students ask clarifying questions on the problem.

*Chris Note: Just an issue of scale, I'd prefer them to ask clarifying questions in breakout sessions and ask instructors/TAs*

Then have students in breakout sections work to solve the problem listing:

1. Edge-case inputs (there's a test case skipped for this)
1. Analyze the solved problem for time/space complexity
1. Refactor as a team (3-4 students) and explain the improved time/space complexity.

## Close the Lesson - 15 minutes

Review solutions and ask students to explain their analysis. We will not have time for all students to present solutions. Make an effort to get a couple of solutions.

Then before dismissing students remind them about Linked Lists next week and to preview the lesson ahead of time.
