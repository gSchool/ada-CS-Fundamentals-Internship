# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview 

We have observed that a breadth first search traversal of a tree allows us to find the shortest path between any two nodes in an unweighted graph. In an unweighted graph, the length of a path is equal to the number of the edges in the path.

With a weighted graph, finding the shortest path between two nodes looks slightly different. We consider the weight of each edge to be the 'length' or 'distance' of the edge. We calculate the total length of a path by summing the weights of all the edges that make up at the path.

Below are two versions of the same graph: the version on the left is unweighted and the version on the right is weighted.

Say we want to find the shortest path from Node B to Node D. In the unweighted graph, the shortest path would be along the direct edge from B to D for a path of length 1. 

However, in the weighted graph, we see the shortest path from Node B to Node D travels from Node B to Node A, from Node A to Node C, and finally from Node C to Node D. The combined length of the path is the sum of the corresponding edges: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. Because the edge directly between Node B to Node D has a weight or length of 10, it is considered a longer path even though it is a more direct route. 

![Weighted v Unweighted Graph Comparison](./images/weighted-v-unweighted.png)

Because of the change in how we calculate shortest paths when weighted edges exist, we are not able to use breadth first search to find the shortest path in weighted graphs. We need a new algorithm: Dijkstra's. 

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm takes a weighted graph and determines the least costly path from a specified start node to every other _reachable_ node in the graph.


Dijkstra's algorithm works by initially overestimating the cost to travel from the start node to every other node in the graph. It then operates similarly to breadth first search. Beginning at the given start node, Dijkstra's algorithm visits each direct neighbor of the current node. As it visits new nodes, the algorithm uses the weights of the corresponding edges to adjust the original estimated cost to each neighbor. 

We can see how it works in more detail with an example. The video walkthrough of this example is included at the top of this section.

![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 0](./images/dijkstras-0.png)
Step 0. We start with a weighted graph. 

![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 1](./images/dijkstras-1.png)
Step 1. We identify our start node, in this example Node A, and set the cost to travel from the start node to all nodes except itself to infinity, an obvious overestimation. The distance of the start node to itself is set to 0.

In the diagram above, the costs are denoted in magenta. 

```
current: A

costs/distances:
    - A: 0
    - B: ∞
    - C: ∞
    - D: ∞
    - E: ∞
    - F: ∞
```
![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 2](./images/dijkstras-2.png)
Step 2. We begin by visiting our start node, Node A, and looking at each of its edges. For each of Node A's edges, we check if the cost to travel along that edge to its neighbor is less than the current estimate of the cost to reach that neighbor. If so, we reset the distance of that neighbor to be equal to the weight of the edge. Since at this point in our traversal, all of the nodes have an estimated cost of infinity, the cost of traveling to each of Node A's neighbors will decrease.

For example, in the diagram above the edge from Node A to Node B has a weight of 10. 10 is clearly less than our current estimate of the cost to travel from Node A to B, infinity, so we update the cost of traveling from Node A to Node B to be the lesser value of 10. 

We add our start node to a list of visited nodes.

In the diagram above, visited nodes and edges are identified in teal. 

```
current: A

visited nodes: A

costs/distances:
    - A: 0
    - B: 10
    - C: ∞
    - D: 3
    - E: 6
    - F: ∞
```
![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 3](./images/dijkstras-3.png)
Step 3. We choose to visit Node D next because of all the unvisited nodes, it is currently estimated to be closest to our start node, Node A. Using the same methodology as Step 2, we look at Node D's _untravelled_ edges.

Node D has two unvisited edges, one to Node C and one to Node F. Notice that both of these nodes are not direct neighbors of our start node, Node A. Because our goal is to calculate the minimum cost to get from Node A to Nodes C and F, when considering whether we should update the cost to get to each of these nodes, we need to sum the cost of the edge from Node D to our destination node and whatever the cost to get from Node A to node D is. 

For example, from the work we did in Step 2, we know the cost to get from our start node to node D is 3. The weight of the edge from Node D to C is also 3. 3 + 3 = 6 which is less than the current estimate of infinity so we revise our estimate of the minimum cost to travel from Node A to Node C to be 6. 

We add Node D to the list of visited nodes and update the queue with all Node D's unvisited neighbors.

```
current: D

visited nodes: A, D

costs/distances:
    - A: 0
    - B: 10
    - C: 6
    - D: 3
    - E: 6
    - F: 15
```
![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 4](./images/dijkstras-4.png)
Step 4. Of the unvisited nodes in the graph, there is a tie for the node with minimum listed distance from our start node, Node A. Both Node C and Node E have a cost/distance of 6. We can choose either. Let's visit C next. 

Node C's only unvisited neighbor is Node B. Following the same logic as in Step 3, we sum the cost of travelling from our start node Node A to Node C with the sum of the edge from Node C to Node B. 
6 + 2 = 8 which is less than the currently listed cost of travel from Node A to Node B, 10 so we update our cost/distances list with our newly found minimum cost.

```
current: C

visited nodes: A, D, C

costs/distances:
    - A: 0
    - B: 8
    - C: 6
    - D: 3
    - E: 6
    - F: 15
```

![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 5](./images/dijkstras-5.png)
Step 5. Now Node E is the next as yet unvisited node that is closest to our starting point, Node A.

Node E's only unvisited neighbor is Node F. The minimum cost to travel from Node A to Node F is currently estimated to be 15 via the path from Node A -> Node D -> Node F. 

The sum of the cost to travel from Node A to Node E plus the cost to travel along Node E to Node F is 8. The cost of this new path 8 is less than that of the previously found path 15, so we revise our costs/distances list to reflect our new minimum cost.

We add Node E to the list of visited nodes, and its unvisited neighbor, Node F, to the queue.

```
current: E

visited nodes: A, D, C, E 

costs/distances:
    - A: 0
    - B: 8
    - C: 6
    - D: 3
    - E: 6
    - F: 8
```

![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 6](./images/dijkstras-6.png)
Step 6. Once again, we have a tie for the unvisited node that is the least far from the start node, Node A. Node B and Node F have equivalent listed cost/distance of 8 from Node A. Let's choose to visit Node B.

Node B has no unvisited neighbors, so we so we do not need to perform any further calculations. 

```
current: B

visited nodes: A, D, C, E, B

costs/distances:
    - A: 0
    - B: 8
    - C: 6
    - D: 3
    - E: 6
    - F: 8
```

![Dijkstra's Walkthrough Part 7](./images/dijkstras-7.png)
Step 7. Now we are visiting our final unvisited node, F. Like Node C, Node F has no unvisited neighbors.

We simply mark it as visited and then we are done! Our list of costs/distances now represents the minimum cost to travel from Node A to every node in the graph.

```
current: F

visited nodes: A, B, D, E, C, F

costs/distances:
    - A: 0
    - B: 8
    - C: 6
    - D: 3
    - E: 6
    - F: 8
```

## Limitations of Dijkstra's

There are limitations to Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's _does not work_ for graphs with negative weights. To find the shortest path in a graph with negative weights we can use the [Bellman Ford algorithm](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/bellman-ford-algorithm). This algorithm is outside the scope of our curriculum and appears only very occasionally in interviews for SDE1 positions, but we encourage you to follow your curiosity.


### !end-callout



## Pseudocode
The process outlined above can be generalized as pseudocode.

Before jumping into the pseudocode, observe that to find the cost of a path from Node A to a non-neighboring node D, we needed to know the cost of travelling from Node A to Node D's direct neighbor along that path.

In the example below, say we want to find the cost of the path from Node A to Node D. Node D's neighbor along that path is Node C. We could also say that Node C is the _previous_ node along that path. 

Observe that the cost to get from Node A to Node D is the cost to get from Node A to Node C plus the cost to get from Node D to Node C. 

![Previous Node in a Graph Example](./images/dijkstra-subpath.png)

This observation illustrates that when calculating the costs of a path between two non-neighboring nodes as we may need to do in Dijkstra's requires us to know the previous node of the end node in the path that we are looking at. As a result, when implementing Djikstra's algorithm it can be useful for us to keep track of each node's previous node along its minimum cost path.


The following pseudocode implementation of Dijkstra's assumes that we are provided with a graph and a starting node.
```
- Create a distances list equal in length to the number of nodes in the graph
    - Tracks the minimum cost/distance from start node to each node in graph
    - Initialize each value to infinity
    - Initialize distances[start_node] to zero
- Create a previous list equal in length to the number of nodes in the graph
    - Tracks the previous node in each node's shortest/minimum cost path
    - Initialize each value to None since we have not yet traversed any paths
- Create a visited list to track which nodes have already been visited
- Create a priority queue and add the start node to it
- While the queue is not empty:
    - Set current as node in the queue with minimum cost
    - Add current to the list of visited nodes
    - loop through all the current node's neighbors
        - if the neighbor has not yet been visited:
            - calculate distance from start node to neighbor via current node
            - If calculated distance < distances[neighbor]
                - distances[neighbor] = caclulated distance
                - previous[neighbor] = current_node
            - queue.append(neighbor)
- Return the previous and distances list

```

### !callout-info

## Priority Queues
You may recall that when we first introduced [queues](../02-linked-lists/04-linked-lists-stacks-queues.md), we said queues remove elements in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. 

<break>

However, in our pseudocode above, we remove elements from the queue in order of minimum cost. This is a special type of queue called a **minimum priority queue**. There are also maximum priority queues where elements are removed in order of maximum cost/priority. 

<break> 

We will use the [`heapq`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) module in Python as our priority queue when we implement Dijkstra's. The internals of implementing a priority queue, also called a heap, are beyond the scope of this course, but we encourage you to follow your curiosity!

##### !question

Given a graph `g` and a start node `s` implement Dijkstra's Algorithm. 

The graph `g` is given as an adjacency matrix where `adj_matrix[i][j]` has a value equal to the weight of the edg between nodes `i` and `j`. A value of zero indicates that there is no edge between node `i` and `j`. The start node `s` is the index of the node. 

Return a dictionary that has two keys:
  - `previous` whose value is a list of the previous nodes in the shortest path from node `s` to the `i`th node
  - `distances` whose value is a list of the distance/cost of the shortest path from node `s` to the `i`th node in the graph `g`.

Example Input:
```python
    g = [
        [0, 4, 0, 0],
        [4, 0, 12, 0],
        [0, 12, 0, 0],
        [0,  0, 0, 0]

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm depends on how the graph given is represented. 

When we use an adjacency matrix as above, the input is of size O(N^2) where N is the number of nodes in the graph. In the solution above, notice that overall the priority queue we loop over should hold each of the nodes in the graph once for an overall time complexity of O(N). 

Inside the while loop, we have an inner for loop to help us access the current node's neighbors.Because the graph is an adjacency matrix, the for loop needs to loop through all N nodes and check if each is a neighbor of the current node. The loop therefore has a time complexity of O(N) making the overall time complexity O(N^2).

You may notice that inside the inner for loop there is a `heappush` operation that happens to be an O(logN) operation. However, because of the conditional this operation is contained within, we only actually execute `heappush` about once per node in the graph so it doesn't increase our overall time complexity. 

If the graph is instead provided as an adjacency list, then it is no longer necessary to loop through each node in the graph every time we want to find the neighbors of a particular node. The neighbors can be accessed in O(1) time with `adjacency_list[node_index]`. As a result, the overall traversal is O(N+E) where N is the number of nodes in the graph and E is the number of edges. For each edge we may do our `heappush` operation which is O(log n), so the overall time complexity is O((N+E)logN)

## Why are heapq operations O(logn)?

A priority queue or heap is a type of binary tree, somewhat similar to a binary search tree but with different properties to organize nodes. Each time we perform a `heappop` or `heappush` operation, the methods traverse the tree. At each node they decide to look at either the left or right subtree, halving the remaining section of the tree they need to traverse making it an O(logN) operation.

### Space Complexity 
Regardless of how the graph is represented, our `previous`, `distances`, and `visited` lists will remain the same. Each will hold at most N elements where N is the number of nodes in the graph. As a result, the overall space complexity of Dijkstra's is O(N).

## Using V to define time and space complexity

When referencing outside resources, we may see time and space complexity of graph algorithms defined in terms of V instead of N. V stands for vertex which is another name for node. Both V & N, are valid so long as you remember to define your variables! For clarity, we usually choose to use either V or N consistently across our definitions.

For example, if we say the time complexity of Dijkstra's is O(V), we would say the space complexity is O(V), not O(N).

## Summary

Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest distance path also known as the minimum cost path from any given start node to all other reachable nodes in the graph. Dijkstra's algorithm works on weighted graphs with non-negative edges. 

The algorithm works by first overestimating the cost of reaching all nodes from the start node, and then iteratively relaxing those costs as it traverses each node in the graph. Its traversal prioritizes visiting nodes in the graph that are closer to the start node over nodes that are of a further distance to the start node.
