# Lesson Plan

Graphs & specifically breadth-first and depth-first searches are some of the most common _hard_ problems I (Chris) has seen for fulltime positions among our interns & alumni.

## Lesson Goals

We want students to:

- Be able to explain graphs and graph representations including:
    - Edge lists, adjacency lists, and adjacency matrices
- Write code using breadth-first and depth-first search to solve coding problems

## Before Class

1. Review the types of graph represenations
1. Review breadth-first and depth-first search
1. Review the [sample replit problem](https://replit.com/@ChrisMcAnally/Course-Schedule-Solution).

## Review Algorithms Project - 10 minutes

Start off the lesson by welcoming students to the class and note attendance. You can use the Airtable to record attendance The [C16 Airtable](https://airtable.com/appkfPQ769uxQLSei/tbl6oiA8ZG1wKUonM/viwgf4wesbLFMlg1L?blocks=hide) is linked.

Take a moment to review any questions from Hash Tables and allow students to present their solutions.

## Students may not want to do this

Students can be a bit shy, but you can contact specific students ahead of time asking them to be ready to present, "because you find their solution interesting."  Being prepared helps with student confidence.

## Graphs Introduction - 30 minutes

Then follow the 1st part of the [activity](./03-graphs-activity.md) reviewing:

- Graph represtations
- Graph Algorithms (DFS & BFS)

Walk through converting graphs to adjacency lists and adjacency matrices and then walk through the graph algorithms on those representations.  Use the provided Learn questions to spur discussions.

It could be useful to have a short breakout time to have students explore DFS & BFS solutions on graphs.

## Project Introduction

Spend some time introducing the project and illustrating the graph problem. You can walk through sample graphs coloring nodes while doing BFS or DFS.

## Livecode - 30 minutes

In the livecode walk through using DFS to solve the course schedule problem. 

Remember to:

- Try to get students to navigate as you type.  
- Cause a bug, and try to promote student ideas to fix it.
    - It can be _really_ helpful to cause a problem and then solve it by drawing out the graph and working through the algorithm until the bug is discovered.
- Model how to use the tests and print statements.

## Coding Activity - 45 minutes

We might not have time for this coding activity, but it can be useful practice.

Break students into breakout rooms to practice the replit. Optionally you can talk through some pseudocode before students start working.

Iterate through the breakout rooms answering questions as you go.
