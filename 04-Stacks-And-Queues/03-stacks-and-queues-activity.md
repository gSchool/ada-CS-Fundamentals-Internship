# Activity:  Stacks & Queues

## Goal

Our goal is to practice using and stacks & queues and identifying situations where they are useful.

##### !question

What is an abstract data type?

##### !end-question

##### !options

* A data structure that operates in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner
* A data structure that operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner
* A data structure that is defined by the operations it performs and not a specific implementation
* A data structure that only exists mathematically

##### !end-options

##### !answer

* A data structure that is defined by the operations it performs and not a specific implementation

##### !end-answer

##### !hint

Remember that both stacks & queues are abstract data types and they can be implemented a variety of ways.

A stack performs in a ______ manner.

##### !end-question

##### !end-options

##### !answer

* Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)

##### !end-answer

##### !explanation

With a stack, the last item added is the first item removed.

* title: Why would a circular buffer be useful to implement a queue?
* points: 1
* topics: python, queues, circular-buffer

##### !question

In your own words, why would a circular buffer be useful to implement a queue?

##### !end-question

##### !placeholder

Why use a circular buffer in a queue?

##### !end-placeholder

##### !explanation

A circular buffer maintains O(1) insertion and removal time complexities and maintains all the elements in an array for quick transfer to external media.  The elements are not fragmented across memory like in a linked list.

## Livecode - Project Introduction

As a class we will check out  the [project](./02-stacks-and-queues-checkpoint.md) and work through the `enqueue` method.  The purpose is to gain familiarity with the project and to learn how to interact with a circular buffer.

Walkthrough with:

- Constructor
- enqueue

### Leetcode Style Question

Next we can try to use a stack to solve a LinkedList problem.

In this problem we need to:

1. Split the linked list into two halves
1. Reverse the second half (using a stack)
1. Merge the two halves together as a single interleaved linked list

**Exercise:**

- [Reorder Linked List](https://replit.com/@adadev/reorderlinkedlist#README.md)

## Activity - Group Work - Daily Temperatures

- [Activity Replit](https://replit.com/@adadev/Daily-Temperatures#README.md)

### Getting Started

In small groups of 3-4, **one student** will *fork* the given replit and then share a collaboration link with the rest of the team.

### Exercise

As a team complete the method in the replit.  There is a suggested solution in the `README.md` file. As a team read through the description and discuss how to implement the solution.

Then try to implement the solution as a team.

If you finish early, you can depart the session or work on the project, with instructor support available.

### !callout-secondary

## Suggestion:  Start The Project Now

It can be a *really* good idea to start the project with classmates and instructional staff around to ask questions of. Getting a solid start to a project makes the entire thing go easier.
